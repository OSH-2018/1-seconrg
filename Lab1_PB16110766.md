1. ## Environment

   1) Debain ver 9.4  (previous)

   2) arch ver 4.15.14  (now)

   3) qemu ver 2.11.1

   4) gdb 8.1

2. ## Purpose

   1) To learn the basic operations on Linux, using the command line to give instructions to the system.

   2) To understand the key procedures in the start of the Linux operating system and find some key events (at least two of them)

   3) Make good use of virtual machine and other softwares (such as qemu and gdb) to track down the kernel

   4) Learn how to compile the Linux kernel

3. ## Procedure

   As it is hard to trace a REAL-linux operation system, we used a virtual machine to simulate the procedure.

   1) Download all the necessities. (This process was dealed with under Debian)

   ​	Use the command line "sudo apt-get", we can get qemu and gdb downloaded quickly and efficiently.

   2) Download and complie the kernel

   ​	Go to the website "www.kernel.org" and then got the linux kernel downloaded. After doing that, we can depressed it in the catalogue where it is downloaded. Eventually, we can get into the file and compile it. 

   ​	Before we start compile the kernel, we must do "make menuconfig" to get into the setting and choose "compile the kernel with debug info" to make the following procedures work smoothly. After change the setting, type the command "make -j8" to compile the kernel. This is a rather long time as it can cost 1 hour to finish.

   3) Get the qemu ready (Due to some problems, the following were done under arch linux system)

   ​	Following the steps in part 2), a file named bzImage is created under the catalogue arch/x86/boot/, and that is the target. Type the command "qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel arch/x86/boot/bzImage -S -append nokaslr".  The letters "-append nokaslr" is to make sure that the breakpoint function in the gdb will work normally.

   ​       Then, we can get into the qemu controller by pressing the bottoms "alt+ctrl+2" simultaneously. In the controller, typing the lines as the screenshot shows: 

   https://github.com/OSH-2018/1-seconrg/blob/master/p4.png

   ​       When the screen shows that the qemu is "waiting for gdb connections",it means that it is waiting for the connection of gdb, so the next job is to set up gdb and connect it to the virtual machine.

   4) Start gdb and connect it to qemu

   ​	Open a new terminal and type the following: "gdb vmlinux" and then we can open the procedure of gdb. To connect the two, we must do "target remote localhost:1234" at the line with a beginning of (gdb). 

   ​	After all these things have been done, we can use gdb to set up breakpoints and trace down the kernel. In this experiment, we type " b start_kernel" to create a breakpoint at the function "start_kernel".

   ​

4. ## Results

   With all the procedures done in section 3, we are being able to reach some details in the start of kernel:

   https://github.com/OSH-2018/1-seconrg/blob/master/p1.png

   From the above we can see that when we set a breakpoint at  "start_kernel", we can get many useful informations about what the operating system do after we press the power bottom.

   The function "start_kernel" makes a lot of contributions to the starting process. For instance, it does many initializations to make the system enter a state of service. Its main function is to initialize the system and start the first procedure. After reading the code, we can see the following:

   https://github.com/OSH-2018/1-seconrg/blob/master/p2.png

   In the code, we can see that some initialization like the command line ("setup_command line (command line)") and the page adress(page_address_init();). So it is sure that a lot of things has been down in this function thus it is a key part of the starting process.

   Another function traced back in the experiment is the kernel init(), also positioned in main.c, all the status of the registers are displayed below:

   https://github.com/OSH-2018/1-seconrg/blob/master/p3.png

   As the name indicated, the function is used to initialize the kernel, doing things important such as the initialization of interrupt request(init_IRQ()),etc. Also it is short compare to the start_kernel(), it is also of great importance as to offer the pre-requisite for the future job. 

5. ## Summary

   1)  Owing to the fact that I'm an ameteur to Linux Operating System, I faced a lot of problems duing this experiment. The most severe of them is that  due to some unknown questions, my Debian system crashed in the morning of April 1  and couldn't be recovered in a short time (my classmated were all confused about this), so with my friend, Wenrui Li's help, I reinstalled a arch linux operating system to continue this experiment. And I am REALLY unfamiliar with this system!

   2) This experiment is something a bit hard for a green hand, but we can really learn a lot from it. Besides all the basic operations on Linux, I also learn how to compile the kernel and read some basic code of the linux kernel, so I think all the trials and hardships are worthful and counts a lot.

   3) Thanks to all the helps I got from the TA, and all my classmates and my friends.
